<html><body>Assassin Mentor Frost:<br>
I was told that we have a new assassin. They must have been talking about you. Congratulations on joining Noda.<br>
After completing all the necessary training you will become a full member of the Noda and will be able to complete the tasks of the <font color="LEVEL">Assassin</font>.<br>
Of course, no one should be aware that you are a member of the Noda. Remember that the main thing for an assassin is stealth and caution.
