<html><body>Teleport Device:<br>
This device was installed by ancient Giants to connect the upper and lower levels of the Giant's Cave. Unfortunately, it was damaged during the war between Giants and gods, and the lower level cannot be accessed from here anymore.<br>
The Ivory Tower Wizards restored the device, and now it connects several areas on the upper level of the Giant's Cave.<br>
This Teleport Device is managed by wizards from the Ivory Tower.<br>
