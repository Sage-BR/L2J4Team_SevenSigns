With our class change service you can choose a different class for your character. You need to prepare for it, however<br>
First, you need a <font color="LEVEL">Class Change Coupon</font> that's sold in the Adena store section of the L-Coin Store.<br>
Second, you have to <font color="LEVEL">unequip</font> all <font color="LEVEL">items.</font><br>
Third, you need to free up your <font color="LEVEL">inventory.</font>You will need <font color="LEVEL">at least 30 slots.</font><br>
What's more, <font color="LEVEL">Heroes can't change their class,</font> so a character with this title is ineligible for the service.<br>
Tell me once you're ready, I'll send you to the Additional Services Lab. Talk to the Researcher Hermin there to change class.<br>
