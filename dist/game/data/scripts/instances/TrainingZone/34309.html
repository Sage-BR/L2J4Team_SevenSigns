Hello. My name is Arbana, I'm from the Ivory Tower.<br>
A lot of strange and creepy things have been happening on the continent lately.<br>
Therefore, the magicians from the Ivory Tower offered their services to the rulers of Aden and the Kingdom of Elmore, as well as the leaders of each of the peoples inhabiting the continent. We agreed that the Ivory Tower will help travelers to become stronger quickly.<br>
In order for young heroes to gain experience faster, a special training program was developed. A special device was placed in the Ivory Tower, with which you can move to the place of training.<br>
In order to make the training as successful as possible, we have appointed young heroes of various specialists as mentors, as well as experienced mercenaries.<br>
