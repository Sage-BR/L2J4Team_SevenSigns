Hello! I'm Toka, Arbana's mentee!<br>
Now I'm studying auxiliary magic that works in specific areas. I arrived here with Arbana as she is now in charge of the Training Zone.<br>
Auxiliary magic I use, <font color="LEVEL">boosts offensive abilities</font>. It does not apply to individual travelers, but to <font color="LEVEL">to the entire area</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Choose the auxiliary magic you need</font>, and I will apply it to the entire area where you will train., <font color="LEVEL">It will take some time</font> to cast magic that will affect the entire zone.<br>
What type of offensive auxiliary magic are you interested in?<br>
