Hello! I am Eri, Arbana disciple<br>
I came together with Arbana, who is in charge of the Training Azone, Now I provide defensive buff here.<br>
I mostly use defensive support magic that helps to survive in battle. This magic is not applied to the single adventurer, but to <font color="LEVEL">the entre area</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">When you choose the required type of support magic</font>, i will apply the buff to the zone of you training. The buff will affect the entire area. so <font color="LEVEL">I will need some time to apply it.</font><br>
What type buff are you interested in?<br>
