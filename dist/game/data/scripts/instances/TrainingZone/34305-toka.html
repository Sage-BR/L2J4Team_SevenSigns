Hello! I am Toka, Arbana disciple<br>
I study support magic that effects special zones. I came here togheter with Arbana, who is in charge of the Training Zone.<br>
I use support magic that <font color="LEVEL">enhances attack skills.</font><br>
This magic is not applied to the single Adventurer, but to <font color="LEVEL">the entire area.</font><br>
Choose the buff you need, and i will apply it to the zone of your training. <font color="LEVEL">I will need some time</font> to apply the buff to the entire area.<br>
What type of attack do you need?<br>
