Greetings! I am the Dream Priestess, and I'll be your guide in the Dreamland.<br>
I help those who are willing to enter the Dream Dungeon.<br>
But the journey there is dangerous. You have to gather <font color="LEVEL">a party</font> or <font color="LEVEL">a command channel</font> of 2-10 people whose level is <font color="LEVEL">76 or higher</font>. I won't let you in, otherwise.<br>
To prevent a potential invasion in the Dreamland, the Dream Dungeon gates are opened only once a week.<br>
Are you ready to go inside?<br>
