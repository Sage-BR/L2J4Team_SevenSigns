<html><body>Humanized Rudolph:<br>
Greetings! It's amazing we can meet like this. I'm Rudolph. Yes, the exact Rudolph who pulls Santa's sled.<br>
Curious why do I look like this? It's complicated. I was about to go give everyone presents, but suddenly turned into human.<br>
I cannot help with the sled looking like this, so I left gifts delivery to Santa Claus and decided to guide the adventurers to the city he is it.<br>
By the way! Santa Claus is on his way.<br>
He delivers gifts at 11:00 a.m. and 09:00 p.m. for an hour. Come to me during this time. Go to Santa Claus.<br>
