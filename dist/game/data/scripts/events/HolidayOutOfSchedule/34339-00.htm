<html><body>Holiday Manager Santa Claus<br>
Ho-ho-ho! It's been a long time since I've been to Elmoraden. And the kingdom looks so much better this year! Even with my poor eyesight I couldn't help but notice new territories, new bosses and new classes.<br>
Oh. I'm rambling, and time is wasting... I must give out as many gift as I can. Ironically, event Santa Claus is on schedule. I give out gifts from 11:00 till 12:00 and from 21:00 till 22:00.<br>
I have quite a lot of gifts. And brave warriors, such as yourself, I'm willing to give one gift per day. Hurry up and get yours!<br>
