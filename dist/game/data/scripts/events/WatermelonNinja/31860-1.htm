Watermelons grow up by taking in nectar. After planting a seed, drip nectar on it and it will grow quickly!<br1>
After taking enough nectar, the watermelon will evolve. If you hit it with a weapon, the watermelon will crack open!<br1>
Be careful, there are several things you should look out for.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">First of all, if you hit it before it's fully grown,</font> it will wilt from lack of nutrition.<br1>
Also, since <font color="LEVEL">a watermelon tends to flee</font>, you should try to crack it open before it gets out of hand! Young watermelons that are not fully grown will run off in <font color="LEVEL">3 minutes</font> and fully grown watermelon will run away in <font color="LEVEL">a minute and 30 seconds</font>! <br1>
<font color="LEVEL">Also, a large watermelon can't be opened with a regular weapon! </font>I heard that there are <font color="LEVEL">chrono weapons</font> that produce musical sounds when you hit it against something.  
You will only be able to hit large watermelon with weapons of this type.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">One last thing!  Since it's not easy to open a large watermelon by yourself,</font> you should find a friend who can help you open it.<br1>
Do you understand everything I've told you?<br1>
