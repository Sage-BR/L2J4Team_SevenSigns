Hey, you! You're right, I'm talking you!<br>
Do you know we have a new problem? It's <font color="LEVEL">Keber</font>!
&nbsp;He threatens to Aden.
&nbsp;They say Keber and his lackeys appear
&nbsp;<font color="LEVEL">every hour</font> on the <font color="LEVEL">Plains of Glory, War-Torn Plains and in the Silent Valley</font>.<br>
If you defeat Keber and his servants, you can get <font color="LEVEL">Talisman of Aden</font>.
&nbsp;I can teleport you to the villain. Do to want to go?<br>
