Thanks to <font color="LEVEL">Verlin's</font> efforts, our Aden has become even safer and more beautiful.<br>
Any bug hunter who has found a bug or a game error and reported it is worthy of respect and protection.<br>
That is why I offer the <font color="LEVEL">Verlin's Protection</font> buff. You can get it once a day.<br>
