Nice to meet you. My name is Kiku, I've spent my whole life exploring mysterious locales.<br>
You must have come here through the Forgotten Garden. When a new and unknown place called Garden of Eva was discovered, I asked my Old friend Kukin to guide adventurers to a safe journey. Let me know if you need to teleport to the <font color="LEVEL">Forgotten Garden</font>.<br>
Just remember that there are more dangerous monsters as you go deeper inside.<br>
