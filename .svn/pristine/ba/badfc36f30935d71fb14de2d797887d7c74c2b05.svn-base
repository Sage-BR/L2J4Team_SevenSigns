<html><body>Antharas' Tracker Herphah:<br>
Here it is! I was right! When I stepped into the Dimensional Vortex, I was sure that it would carry me to Antharas.<br>
I think this is a different space, but very similar to the one I know.<br>
You are here alone or with your friends. Antharas is a very dangerous opponent. A small mistake will be easily punished.<br>
If you want, I will move you inside.<br>
