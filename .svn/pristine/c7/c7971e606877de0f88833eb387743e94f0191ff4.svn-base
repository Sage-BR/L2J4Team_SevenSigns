<html><body>Assistant Grill:<br>
Welcome My name is Grill. I help those traveling to the Hot Springs.<br>
These Springs are situated an a volcano, so it's warm here all the year round.<br>
Many people come the Springs to check if the local water is a good as the rumors say.<br>
But I've been sent here to work, and to tell the truth, I'm quite tired of all this heat. I wish I could go some place cooler... Next time I'll ask to assign me where it's not so hot.<br>
By the way, keep in mind that if you see a Hot Springs Nepenthes, then a Morgos Hunter is sure to lurk nearby. So be careful!<br>
