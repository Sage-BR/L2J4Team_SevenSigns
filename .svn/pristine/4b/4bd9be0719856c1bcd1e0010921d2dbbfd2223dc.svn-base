<html><body>Garden Guide Kugin:<br>
There are many forgotten gardens in the continent of Aden. I'm guiding people to those areas where the seal has lifted from here. It's up to you where to go.<br>
If you kill the monsters that have stolen talismans and infiltrated the place, the talisman will be yours, so it will be good to look around.<br>
Going through me can be dangerous, so I recommend going through the access road, but I'll let you go if you're willing. For your reference, the <font color="LEVEL">recommended level is the level that I suggest</font>, so choose a suitable location according to your abilities.<br>
