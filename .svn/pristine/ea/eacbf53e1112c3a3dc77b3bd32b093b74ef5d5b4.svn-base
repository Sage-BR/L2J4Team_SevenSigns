Hey, how did you get to this remote place? That's quite commendable. My name is Muss. I can help you with traveling to Morgos Military Base...<br>
I don't want to boast but I'm a decent warrior myself. So you've been sent to this military base, haven't you?..<br>
Well... Beware of Morgos then. He is quite infamous for gathering miscreants. Recently his forces have really grown in number.<br>
