# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Network Settings
# These settings provide fine-grained control over the network behavior and packet handling within the server application.
# Adjusting these parameters can help optimize network performance and ensure secure communication between the server and clients.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# General Network Settings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Shutdown Wait Time
# Defines the time in seconds the server waits for send/receive packets to be finalized during shutdown.
# Default: 5 seconds
ShutdownWaitTime = 5

# Define if packet dropping is enabled.
# Default: False
DropPackets = False

# Packet Dropping Threshold
# Defines the threshold to drop disposable packets. Higher values allow more packets to be queued
# before dropping starts, potentially reducing packet loss at the cost of higher memory usage.
# Default: 250
DropPacketThreshold = 250

# Fairness Buckets
# The number of buckets used in the fairness controller, which maintains thread fairness among clients.
# Increasing this value may improve fairness in high concurrency environments.
# Default: 1
FairnessBuckets = 1

# Define if the auto reading should be disabled.
# If the auto reading is enabled the server will read the client's packet automatically.
# Other wise the server needs to call the Client#read() when the client packet should be read.
# Default = True
AutoReading = True


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ThreadPool Settings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ThreadPool Size
# Defines the number of threads in the ThreadPool for network operations.
# Use values between 1 and 999 for a fixed thread pool. Any other value defaults to a cached thread pool.
# Default: 2
ThreadPoolSize = 2

# Buffer Segment Size
# Size of segments for dynamic buffers, which are used to increase buffer sizes as needed.
# Default: 64
BufferSegmentSize = 64

# Use Cached Thread Pool (true/false)
# Determines the type of thread pool used for handling network requests.
# - 'true' enables a cached thread pool, which dynamically creates threads as needed and reuses them when they become idle.
#   This is suitable for applications with fluctuating demand, allowing efficient handling of varying workloads.
# - 'false' uses a fixed thread pool with a set number of threads (defined by ThreadPoolSize).
#   This is more suitable for applications with a consistent workload where maintaining a fixed number of threads can ensure resource control.
# Default: false
UseCachedThreadPool = false

# Max Cached Threads
# Specifies the maximum number of threads allowed in the cached thread pool.
# This setting is only relevant if UseCachedThreadPool is set to 'true'.
# It limits the number of threads that can be created in the pool, preventing excessive resource use under high demand.
# A high number allows more flexibility in handling a large number of concurrent tasks but at the risk of higher resource consumption.
# Default: 2147483647 (effectively unlimited)
MaxCachedThreads = 2147483647
