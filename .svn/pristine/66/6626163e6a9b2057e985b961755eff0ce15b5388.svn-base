<html><body>Antharas' Tracker Herphah:<br>
Shh, be quiet! Antharas' lair is nearby.<br>
However, we can't be certain if he is even in there.<br>
It's strange, but I sense the Dimensional Vortex nearby. If Antharas used it to move to another place, that's not good for us.<br>
I'm going through the Vortex to fight Antharas. Are you with me?<br>
