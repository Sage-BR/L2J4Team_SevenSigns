Hellbound is a dangerous place.<br>
That's why Ivory Tower Wizards teleport only warriors who have reached Lv. 85 or higher there.<br>
I appreciate your desire to fight Beleth, but his power will kill weak adventurers at one stroke. Even if you get to the Ivory Tower, the wizards aren't going to teleport you to Hellbound.<br>
They don't want people dying there just for nothing. That's why they accept only help of heroes who have reached Lv. 85 or higher.
