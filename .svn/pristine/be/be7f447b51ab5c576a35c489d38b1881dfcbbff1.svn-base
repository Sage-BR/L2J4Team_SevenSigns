Please, check your <font color="LEVEL">inventory</font>.<br>
To change class, in your <font color="LEVEL">inventory</font> must be <font color="LEVEL">free space</font> and <font color="LEVEL">weight</font>.<br>
Keep unnecessary items in the warehouse, to free 50% weight and at least 30 slots. <br>
Tell me once you're ready.<br>
