Thanks for the help!<br>
Valakas is strongly connected with the Forge of the Gods.<br>
I've been watching this place ever since the Death Knights, the last ones to face the Fire Dragon Valakas, reappeared in these places.<br>
I thought the Death Knights had returned because they sensed the coming awakening of Valakas. And it seems that I was not mistaken.<br>
It seems that a ritual has begun in the depths of the Forge of the Gods, the purpose of which is to awaken the Dragon of Fire.<br>
I'm going to go to the Smithies and find out what's going on there. And I advise you to do the same.
