<html><body>Grocer Shikilro:<br>
Welcome! I have everything... except what I don't have.<br>
How did it happen that I opened a grocery store here, and what is so special about it? Well... Nothing really, but what's the deal - someone has to do the trading, right? So why not me? You know, I tried a lot of things, but I still couldn't find a thing to my liking. Then Frost called me to open a shop here, and my business went uphill!<br>
What am I talking about? You better look at my goods! I have everything you need. Well, take a good look around here.<br>
